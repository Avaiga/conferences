## What is Conferences

Taipy is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our
[website](https://www.taipy.io).

[Conferences](https://github.com/Avaiga/demo-production-planning) is a full application showing how Taipy Core and Taipy Gui can work together to build a minimalist but powerful application.
This demo shows the fundamental mathematical optimization problem of “Production Planning”. The goal is to minimize costs while fulfilling product demand and satisfying capacity constraints.
Some of the constraints can be modified, resulting in different scenarios. For each scenario, different graphical representations are provided. 

### Demo Type
- **Level**: Moderate
- **Topic**: Taipy-GUI, Taipy-Core
- **Components/Controls**: 
  - Taipy GUI: selector, chart, toggle, slider, expandable, table
  - Taipy Core: datanode, pipeline, scenario

## How to run
